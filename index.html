    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <p>2 large potatoes </p>
    <p>2 tablespoons olive oil </p>
    <p>Salt and pepper to taste </p>
        
    <p>Instructions: 
    <p>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </p>
    <p>Wash and scrub the potatoes thoroughly. </p>
    <p>Using a mandoline or sharp knife, slice the potatoes as thinly as possible. </p>
    <p>In a large bowl, toss the potato slices with olive oil and salt and pepper to taste.</p>
    <p>Arrange the potato slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. </p>
    <p>Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the edges start to turn golden brown. </p>
    <p>Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before serving. </p>
    <p>Note: For a crispy texture, it's important to slice the potatoes as thinly as possible and to make sure they are arranged in a single layer on the baking sheet. </p>
