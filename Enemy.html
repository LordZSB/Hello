        <h2>Homemade Burgers</h2>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>1 pound (450g) ground beef (preferably 80/20 lean-to-fat ratio)</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</p>
        <p>4 hamburger buns</p>
        <p>Optional toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, pickles, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise</p>
            
        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <p>Preheat Grill or Pan:</p>
            
        <p>If grilling, preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If cooking indoors, heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat.</p>
        <p>Prepare the Patties:</p>
            
        <p>In a mixing bowl, gently combine the ground beef, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Avoid overmixing, as this can result in tough burgers. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a patty, about 3/4 inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.</p>
        <p>Cook the Patties:</p>
            
        <p>If grilling, place the patties on the preheated grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or until the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C) on an instant-read thermometer.</p>
        <p>If cooking indoors, place the patties in the heated skillet or grill pan and cook for the same amount of time as grilling.</p>
        <p>Toast the Buns:</p>
            
        <p>While the patties are cooking, slice the hamburger buns in half and lightly toast them on the grill or in a separate skillet until golden brown.</p>
        <p>Assemble the Burgers:</p>
            
        <p>Once the patties are cooked to your desired doneness, remove them from the grill or pan and let them rest for a few minutes.</p>
        <p>To assemble the burgers, place a patty on the bottom half of each toasted bun. Add your desired toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, pickles, ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise.</p>
        <p>Finish by placing the top half of the bun on each burger.</p>
